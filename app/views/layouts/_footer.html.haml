          Graduating from the Art Institute of Colorado in the summer of 2012 with a BA in Digital Filmmaking
          and Video Production. I'm a do-it-all guy who does everything from the editing, graphics, shoots
          collaborating, with clients and everything in between.

          Pushing the boundaries of creativity is where Ben's passion is. When you drop in to visit, you'll
          probably find Ben reading, researching, or dreaming up new and fun ways of creating awesome videos.
